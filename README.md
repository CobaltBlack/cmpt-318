Project for CMPT 318 Fall 2017
by Joshua MacManus and Eric Liu

## Dependencies

* Python 3
* NumPy
* Pandas
* MatlabPlot
* scikit-learn
* SciPy
* Statsmodels
* UTM (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/utm)

## Running the code

It is recommended to run `app.py` in Spyder. No additional command line arguments are required. 

It is also possible to run `app.py` in the command line using:

```
python3 app.py
```

## Output data
Running app.py should produce various files and print out the data analysis.
1. If the files containing the cleaned data `res/files/city_data.csv` or `res/files/crime_data.csv` are missing, the program should automatically recreate them using the provided raw data.
2. The program should plot several figures and save them to the root directory.
3. The program should print the raw results of the data analysis to the console.
